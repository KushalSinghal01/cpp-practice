# Big-O Time Complexity (Quick Notes)

## Common Time Complexities
- O(1): Constant time
- O(log n): Binary search
- O(n): Single loop
- O(n log n): Efficient sorting (merge sort, quick sort average)
- O(n^2): Nested loops (bubble sort)
- O(2^n): Recursive problems (naive fibonacci)

## Examples
- Linear search: O(n)
- Binary search (sorted): O(log n)
- Bubble sort: O(n^2)
- STL sort(): O(n log n)

## Why It Matters?
- For large input, fast algorithm is important
- Optimization helps in interviews and competitive programming
